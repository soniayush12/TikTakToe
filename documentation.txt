Title = Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Introduction:
This program implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in C. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to form a row, column, or diagonal of their symbol (X or O) to win the game.

Program Structure:
The program consists of several functions to manage different aspects of the game:
- draw(): Displays the current state of the game board.
- player(): Prompts the current player to enter their move (row and column).
- response(): Validates the player's move and updates the game board accordingly.
- winner(): Displays a congratulatory message if a player wins the game.
- gamedraw(): Displays a message if the game ends in a draw.
- checkwinner(): Checks if there's a winner or if the game has ended in a draw.
- main(): The main function controls the flow of the game by repeatedly calling other functions until the game is over.
